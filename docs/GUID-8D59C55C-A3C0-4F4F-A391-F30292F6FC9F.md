# Configuring the SDCARD Host applications

Path of the SDCARD host applications within the repository is **apps/i2c\_bootloader/**

**Configuring the SDCARD Host application**

**Follow below steps only when Host development kit is different than Target Development Kit**

1.  Open the host\_app\_sdcard/firmware/\*.X project in MPLABX IDE

2.  Open the "user.h" file as shown below:

    ![i2c_bootloader_host_app_sdcard_user_ide](GUID-4E133BA4-A9D4-47AD-85F8-2BADF626191C-low.png)

3.  In the "user.h" file specify the Bootloader Target Device used using the predefined macros<br />\#define APP\_I2C\_BOOTLOADER\_TARGET\_DEVICE SAM\_D21\_XPRO

    ![i2c_bootloader_host_app_sdcard_user_config](GUID-01DFE9E6-612F-4F94-A887-AEDDF780DC11-low.png)

4.  Navigate to the **\#if block** for the specified **Bootloader Target Device** and verify the below settings are as expected.

    -   **APP\_BINARY\_FILE:** Name of the Application binary copied to the SDCARD

    -   **APP\_I2C\_SLAVE\_ADDR:** I2C slave address

    -   **APP\_ERASE\_PAGE\_SIZE:** Erase page size of the target \(target = MCU being programmed\)

    -   **APP\_PROGRAM\_PAGE\_SIZE:** Program page size of the target \(target = MCU being programmed\).

        -   The macro can either be set to the program page size or can be set to the size of the erase page size of the target.

        -   In the demo example, the macro is set equal to the size of the erase page.

        -   On embedded host where RAM is limited, the macro may be set to the actual program page size to reduce the RAM used to hold the program data.

            -   For example, for SAM D20, the macro can be set either to 64 \(program page size\) or 256 \(erase page size\)

    -   **APP\_IMAGE\_START\_ADDR:** User application start address \(This value should be same as the application start address specified in Application Configurations steps\).

        -   If the bootloader itself is being upgraded then the APP\_IMAGE\_START\_ADDR must be set to 0x00 \(start of bootloader\)

        -   Ensure that the bootloader and application are also configured with the same value of user application start address


**Follow below steps only when multiple Target development kit are to be programmed using the same Host development kit**

1.  Open the host application source file

2.  The **APP\_BL\_NUM\_I2C\_SLAVES** must be set equal to the number of slaves being programmed on the I2C bus

3.  Specify the following details in the **firmwareUpdateInfo data structure** for other slaves on the bus:

    ![i2c_bootloader_host_app_sdcard_config](GUID-038B1720-70AA-4278-8560-8D02FAB6C159-low.png)

    -   **i2cSlaveAddr:** Specify the I2C slave address

    -   **erasePageSize:** Specify the erase page size of the target \(target = MCU being programmed\)

    -   **programPageSize:** Specify the program page size of the target \(target = MCU being programmed\).

        -   It can either be set to the program page size or can be set to the size of the erase page size of the target.

        -   In the demo example, it is set equal to the size of the erase page.

        -   On embedded host where RAM is limited, it may be set to the actual program page size to reduce the RAM used to hold the program data.

            -   For example, for SAM D20, the programPageSize can be set either to 64 \(program page size\) or 256 \(erase page size\).

    -   **appStartAddr:** Specify the user application start address \(This value should be same as the application start address specified in Application configuration\).

        -   If the bootloader itself is being upgraded then the appStartAddr must be set to 0x00 \(start of the bootloader\).

        -   Also, ensure that the bootloader is also configured with the same value of application start address.

    -   **filename:** Specify the filename of the application binary
