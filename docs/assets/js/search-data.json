(a) Licensee will ensure Third Party compliance with the terms of this Agreement. (b) Licensee will not: (i) engage in unauthorized use, modification, disclosure or distribution of Software or Documentation, or its derivatives; (ii) use all or any portion of the Software, Documentation, or its derivatives except in conjunction with Microchip Products; or (iii) reverse engineer (by disassembly, decompilation or otherwise) Software or any portion thereof; or (iv) copy or reproduce all or any portion of Software, except as specifically allowed by this Agreement or expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding the foregoing limitations. (c) Licensee must include Microchip’s copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices in all copies of the Software, Documentation, and its derivatives. Licensee may not remove or alter any Microchip copyright or other proprietary rights notice posted in any portion of the Software or Documentation. (d) Licensee will defend, indemnify and hold Microchip and its subsidiaries harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), liabilities, and losses, including without limitation product liability claims, directly or indirectly arising from or related to: (i) the use, modification, disclosure or distribution of the Software, Documentation or any intellectual property rights related thereto; (ii) the use, sale, and distribution of Licensee Products or Third Party Products, and (iii) breach of this Agreement. THE FOREGOING STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT. | Confidentiality. (a) Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not limited to the Source Code, Object Code and library files) and its derivatives, Documentation and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas relating to the Software and the Documentation are proprietary information belonging to Microchip and its licensors (“Proprietary Information”). Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and shall similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing. Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by it independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure. If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement provided that Licensee gives Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure, Licensee cooperates with Microchip to protect Proprietary Information, and Licensee complies with any protective order in place and discloses only the information required by process of law. (b) Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure of the Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damages alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if such provisions are violated. Licensee, therefore, agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to petition for injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. | Ownership of Proprietary Rights. (a) Microchip and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation (“Proprietary Rights”) including, but not limited to: (i) patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in the Software, Documentation, and underlying technology; (ii) the Software as implemented in any device or system, all hardware and software implementations of the Software technology (expressly excluding Licensee and Third Party code developed and used in conformance with this Agreement solely to interface with the Software and Licensee Products and/or Third Party Products); and (iii) all modifications and derivative works thereof (by whomever produced). Further, modifications and derivative works shall be considered works made for hire with ownership vesting in Microchip on creation. To the extent such modifications and derivatives do not qualify as a “work for hire,” Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, assigns and conveys the exclusive copyright thereof to Microchip, free and clear of any and all liens, claims or other encumbrances, to the fullest extent permitted by law. Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in Section 1 above. (b) Licensee shall have no right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of the Software, Documentation or any related intellectual property rights except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. | Termination of Agreement. Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement terminates immediately, without notice by Microchip, upon a failure by License or Third Party to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Further, Microchip may also terminate this Agreement upon reasonable belief that Licensee or Third Party have failed to comply with this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee and Third Party will immediately stop using the Software, Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such copies, remove Software from any of Licensee’s tangible media and from systems on which the Software exists, and stop using, disclosing, copying, or reproducing Software (even as may be permitted by this Agreement). Termination of this Agreement will not affect the right of any end user or consumer to use Licensee Products or Third Party Products provided that such products were purchased prior to the termination of this Agreement. | Dangerous Applications. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance (“Dangerous Applications”). Dangerous Applications include the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, weapons systems, or any environment or system in which the failure of the Software could lead directly or indirectly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Microchip specifically disclaims (a) any express or implied warranty of fitness for use of the Software in Dangerous Applications; and (b) any and all liability for loss, damages and claims resulting from the use of the Software in Dangerous Applications. | Warranties and Disclaimers.

The aggregate and cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors for damages hereunder will in no event exceed $1000 or the amount Licensee paid Microchip for the Software and Documentation, whichever is greater. Licensee acknowledges that the foregoing limitations are reasonable and an essential part of this Agreement. | General. (a) Governing Law, Venue and Waiver of Trial by Jury. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS. Licensee agrees that any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, Software or Documentation shall be brought in the courts of State of Arizona. The parties agree to waive their rights to a jury trial in actions relating to this Agreement. (b) Attorneys’ Fees.
