# Configuring an application to be bootloaded for CORTEX-M based MCUs

**Application settings in MCC system configuration**

1.  Launch MCC for the application project to be configured

2.  Select **system** component from the project graph and configure the below highlighted settings

3.  Disable Fuse Settings:

    -   Fuse settings needs to be disabled for the application which will be boot-loaded as the fuse settings are supposed to be programmed through programming tool from bootloader code. Also the fuse settings are not programmable through firmware

    -   Enabling the fuse settings also increases the size of the binary when generated through the hex file

    -   When updating the bootloader itself, make sure that the fuse settings for the bootloader application are also disabled

4.  Specify the Application Start Address:

    -   Specify the Start address from where the application will run under the **Application Start Address \(Hex\)** option in System block in MCC.

    -   This value should be equal to or greater than the bootloader size and must be aligned to the erase unit size on that device.

    -   As this value will be used by bootloader to Jump to application at device reset it should match the value provided to bootloader code

    -   The **Application Start Address \(Hex\)** will be used to generate XC32 compiler settings to place the code at intended address

    -   After the project is regenerated, the ROM\_ORIGIN and ROM\_LENGTH are the XC32 linker variables which will be overridden with value provided for **Application Start Address \(Hex\)** and can be verified under Options for xc32-ld in Project Properties in MPLABX IDE as shown below.

**MPLAB X Settings**

-   Specifying post build option to automatically generate the binary file from hex file once the build is complete

    -   The generated binary file can directly be copied on to the SD card when using **host\_app\_sdcard** host application

    -   The generated binary file will serve as an input to the **btl\_bin\_to\_c\_array.py** to generate a C style array containing HEX data when the **host\_app\_nvm** host application is used

    `${MP_CC_DIR}/xc32-objcopy -I ihex -O binary ${DISTDIR}/${PROJECTNAME}.${IMAGE_TYPE}.hex ${DISTDIR}/${PROJECTNAME}.${IMAGE_TYPE}.bin`

**Additional settings \(Optional\)**

-   **RAM\_ORIGIN** and **RAM\_LENGTH** values should be provided for reserving configured bytes from start of RAM to **trigger bootloader from firmware**

-   Under Project Properties, expand options for xc32-ld and define the values for **RAM\_ORIGIN** and **RAM\_LENGTH** under Additional options

-   This is optional and can be ignored if not required
